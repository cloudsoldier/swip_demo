# Social Work Induction Programme (SWIP) digital service

This repository houses the core digital service for the Social Work Induction programme in children's social care. The digital service is based on Moodle LMS.

## Local development setup
To install Moodle LMS and run it locally the recommended tool is DDEV. DDEV is an open-source tool for launching containerised local web development environments quickly and easily, without requiring extensive Docker knowledge. 

To install DDEV, follow the official guide for your operating system: [Installing DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/install/).

Once DDEV is successfully installed, follow the DDEV quickstart guide for installing and running a Moodle site: [Moodle quickstart](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/quickstart/#moodle).

Note: The LTS version of Moodle will be installed.
